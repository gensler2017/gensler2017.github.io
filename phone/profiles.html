I’ve done the same commute for about 5 years so it’s very regular and not surprising for me.  I enjoy when its nice out and having that kind of transition time.  I think sometimes at small moments I wish I could have an ipad up at my home so I can see when the bus is coming so I can plan around whether or not I am going to putz around for 5 minutes or have to catch it immediately.  The train is smelly and crowded and it would be good to know ahead of time if I have to stand or I can sit and know the amount of activity on the train at any given time.  I know having done the same commute what times in the morning the commutes are super crowded.  The trains and the buses are rarely synced up which is strange.  There is an app that I use and I can look at when a bus or a train is going to be there and I know that the bus is never really right because of my location and the activity at the intersection just before my stop, so there can always be improvements to those estimations but they are generally pretty good right now.",

The most physically and emotionally impactful space is the museum of the murdered Jews by Daniel Libeskind. I love cathedrals and religious spaces because they are incredible examples of imagination and care and very emotive spaces.  I really like being in big cavernous parking garages like under the McCormick Place because you get lost in this netherworld and get lost in any sense of any time or place.  I really love space and really love being in people’s homes where they consider space an extension of themselves and even if they don’t consciously, people that put any attention or care because it really personifies people in really interesting ways.

In fact, it's becoming more and more important and central to business. \nYou might be thinking data = technology, but data = information and technology is a way to produce, record, and present information. So, they are intrinsically related. Data is the material byproduct of technology.
